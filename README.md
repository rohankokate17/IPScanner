# IPScanner
1. Define Requirements
Network Range: Specify the range of IP addresses to scan.
Scanning Features: Decide if you want to include features like port scanning or additional details gathering.
Output Format: Determine how results should be displayed (console output, file, etc.).
2. Set Up Your Java Project
Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse). Make sure you have JDK installed.
3. Key Considerations
Network Permissions: Ensure you have permission to scan the network. Unauthorized scanning can lead to legal issues or network disruptions.
Timeouts: Adjust the timeout as needed based on network performance and reliability.
Error Handling: Handle exceptions gracefully to prevent crashes and provide meaningful error messages.
4 . Testing
Different Networks: Test your scanner on various network configurations to ensure accuracy.
Performance Testing: Evaluate performance, especially with larger IP ranges
5 . Security and Ethical Considerations
Ethics: Always use IP scanning tools ethically and with permission. Unauthorized scanning can result in legal consequences and disrupt network operations.
Security: Ensure your code handles sensitive information correctly and does not expose vulnerabilities.
